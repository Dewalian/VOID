On level up, InreaseDifficulty function is called, where the enemy spawn rate is shorter and enemy speed is faster.
But, your tank also gain a buff, where its shoot CD is reduced, movement speed is faster, and HP is increased.

The tank has an invisible zone where enemies can't spawn, so the enemies can't immediately collide with player upon spawn.
